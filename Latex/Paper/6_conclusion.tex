\section{Conclusion}
\label{Chap6}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Some concluding remarks and an outlook
	\item Keep short, around 1-2 pages
	\item Natural extension: case with explanatory variables
	\item We advocate for an interval instead of an point forecast. Therefore also for an interval estimate of the treatment effect. Report more measures of uncertainty than permutation p-values.
\end{itemize}
