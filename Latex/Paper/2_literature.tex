\subsection{Synthetic Control}
The \ac{SC} method was developed by Alberto Abadie and colleagues in a series of influential papers (\cite{abadie:2003}, \cite{abadie:2007}, \cite{abadie:2015}). The method is designed to estimate the causal effect of a treatment in a setting with a single treatment unit and a number of potential control units. Pre- and post-treatment data are observed for the treatment and control units for the outcome of interest and for a set of covariates that explain the outcome. \\
In their canonical 2003 article, Abadie and Gardeazabal assess the causal economic effects of conflict, using terrorist conflicts in the Basque Country as a comparative case study. Combining aspects of the matching and difference-in-difference literature, the scholars invent the \ac{SC} method, which pursues the target to estimate causal treatment effects in observational studies. In their specific application example, they find that per capita \ac{GDP} of the treatment unit (Basque Country) declined about 10\% compared to the synthesized control unit. The key underlying assumption is
